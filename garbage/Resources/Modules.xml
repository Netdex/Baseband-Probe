            Having Windows Updates enabled is essential in keeping your system up to date and secure against the latest
            vulnerabilities.
            When a problem is found in Windows that might compromise your security, the vendor creates a patch delivered
            in the form of updates
            to secure your system against these vulnerabilities. When updates are disabled, you do not receive this
            patches.

            Windows has a built-in manager for different types of networks. This is why when you connect to a new
            network in Windows, it asks you to classify it as a "Home", "Work" or "Public" network. As Windows uses
            relaxed data sharing and security settings when you set a network as a "Home Network", it is imperative
            that these networks are well-secured.

                Your primary network is not encrypted and password protected. Both of these are extremely important to
